These bindings are actually present in the `run`-folder as `_pyhelios.pyd/[.so]`, but are imported when you import `pyhelios`. The python scripts contain functions to create and work with simulations (e.g., `SimulationBuilder`) and a `util` subpackage, where tools for scene generation and flight planning are found.\n",
