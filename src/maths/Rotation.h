/**
* This class implements rotations in a three-dimensional space.
*
* <p>Rotations can be represented by several different mathematical
* entities (matrices, axe and angle, Cardan or Euler angles,
* quaternions). This class presents an higher level abstraction, more
* user-oriented and hiding this implementation details. Well, for the
* curious, we use quaternions for the internal representation. The
* user can build a rotation from any of these representations, and
* any of these representations can be retrieved from a
* <code>Rotation</code> instance (see the various constructors and
* getters). In addition, a rotation can also be built implicitly
* from a set of vectors and their image.</p>
* <p>This implies that this class can be used to convert from one
* representation to another one. For example, converting a rotation
* matrix into a set of Cardan angles from can be done using the
* following single line of code:</p>
* <pre>
* double[] angles = new Rotation(matrix, 1.0e-10).getAngles(RotationOrder.XYZ);
* </pre>
* <p>Focus is oriented on what a rotation <em>do</em> rather than on its
* underlying representation. Once it has been built, and regardless of its
* internal representation, a rotation is an <em>operator</em> which basically
* transforms three dimensional {@link Vector3D vectors} into other three
* dimensional {@link Vector3D vectors}. Depending on the application, the
* meaning of these vectors may vary and the semantics of the rotation also.</p>
* <p>For example in an spacecraft attitude simulation tool, users will often
* consider the vectors are fixed (say the Earth direction for example) and the
* frames change. The rotation transforms the coordinates of the vector in inertial
* frame into the coordinates of the same vector in satellite frame. In this
* case, the rotation implicitly defines the relation between the two frames.</p>
* <p>Another example could be a telescope control application, where the rotation
* would transform the sighting direction at rest into the desired observing
* direction when the telescope is pointed towards an object of interest. In this
* case the rotation transforms the direction at rest in a topocentric frame
* into the sighting direction in the same topocentric frame. This implies in this
* case the frame is fixed and the vector moves.</p>
* <p>In many case, both approaches will be combined. In our telescope example,
* we will probably also need to transform the observing direction in the topocentric
* frame into the observing direction in inertial frame taking into account the observatory
* location and the Earth rotation, which would essentially be an application of the
* first approach.</p>
*
* <p>These examples show that a rotation is what the user wants it to be. This
* class does not push the user towards one specific definition and hence does not
* provide methods like <code>projectVectorIntoDestinationFrame</code> or
* <code>computeTransformedDirection</code>. It provides simpler and more generic
* methods: {@link #applyTo(Vector3D) applyTo(Vector3D)} and {@link
* #applyInverseTo(Vector3D) applyInverseTo(Vector3D)}.</p>
*
* <p>Since a rotation is basically a vectorial operator, several rotations can be
* composed together and the composite operation <code>r = r<sub>1</sub> o
* r<sub>2</sub></code> (which means that for each vector <code>u</code>,
* <code>r(u) = r<sub>1</sub>(r<sub>2</sub>(u))</code>) is also a rotation. Hence
* we can consider that in addition to vectors, a rotation can be applied to other
* rotations as well (or to itself). With our previous notations, we would say we
* can apply <code>r<sub>1</sub></code> to <code>r<sub>2</sub></code> and the result
* we get is <code>r = r<sub>1</sub> o r<sub>2</sub></code>. For this purpose, the
* class provides the methods: {@link #applyTo(Rotation) applyTo(Rotation)} and
* {@link #applyInverseTo(Rotation) applyInverseTo(Rotation)}.</p>
*
* <p>Rotations are guaranteed to be immutable objects.</p>
