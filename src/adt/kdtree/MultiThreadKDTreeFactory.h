/**
 * @author Alberto M. Esmoris Pena
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * @brief Decorator for any KDTree factory which provides support for multi
 *  thread KDTree building
 *
 * When combining geometry-level and node-level parallel building strategies,
 *  both are assumed to support the same max number of threads.
 *  To better understand this, let \f$\Phi(t)\f$ be the number of currently
 *  available threads for the geometry-level strategy at time \f$t\f$ while
 *  \f$\Psi(t)\f$ denotes the number of currently available threads for the
 *  node-level thread pool at time \f$t\f$.
 * Now, if the maximum number of threads is \f$k\f$, at the beginning it
 *  would be \f$\Phi(t)=k\f$ and \f$\Psi(t)=0\f$. Once all geometry-level
 *  splits have been done, then \f$\Phi(t)=0\f$ and \f$\Psi(t)=k\f$. At the
 *  last depth for geometry-level strategy, always that a split is finished
 *  involved threads will go from geometry-level mode to node-level
 *  thread pool. At any time, threads for geometry-level and node-level are
 *  related by following expresion \f$\Psi(t) = k - \Phi(t)\f$.

  /**
   * @brief Recursively build a KDTree for given primitives using given
   *  KDTreeFactory (kdtf) in a geometry-level parallelization context.
   * The geometry-level parallelization implies distributing threads among
   *  splits as uniform as possible, while satisfying the constraint that
   *  any split must have at least one associated thread. It is the way to go
   *  for building the upper levels of the KDTree.
   * For the sake of understanding, let \f$P_i\left[a, b\right]\f$ note
   *  the \f$i\f$-th split associated to threads from \f$a\f$-th (inclusive)
   *  to \f$b\f$-th (inclusive). Thus, if \f$d\f$ is said to be
   *  the tree depth and \f$k\f$ is the number of threads,
   *  then it is possible to modellize the behavior of the geometry level
   *  parallel building process as follows:
   *
   * \f[
   * \left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
   *  d = 0 &:& \left\{
   *      P_0[a_0, b_0]
   *  \right\} \\
   *  d = 1 &:& \left\{
   *      P_0\left[a_0, b_0\right],
   *      P_1\left[a_1, b_1\right]
   *  \right\} \\
   *  d = 2 &:& \left\{
   *      P_0\left[a_0, b_0\right],
   *      P_1\left[a_1, b_1\right],
   *      P_2\left[a_2, b_2\right],
   *      P_3\left[a_3, b_3\right]
   *  \right\} \\
   *  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots
   * \end{array}\right.
   * \f]
   *
   * It is worth to mention that \f$a_{i+1} = b_{i}+1\f$.
   *  Now, for generalization purposes let
   *  \f$\alpha=\left\lfloor{\frac{k}{2^d}}\right\rfloor\f$ and
   *  \f$\beta \equiv k \mod 2^d\f$. In consequence, at any depth level
   *  \f$d\f$ it is possible to define \f$\forall i,\; P_i = [a_i, b_i]\f$
   *  where:
   *
   * \f[
   * a_i = \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
   *  i\alpha &,& i < 2^d - \beta \\
   *  i(\alpha+1) - 2^d + \beta &,& i \geq 2^d - \beta
   * \end{array}\right.
   * \f]
   *
   * \f[
   * b_i = \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
   *  \alpha(i+1)-1 &,& i < 2^d - \beta \\
   *  i(\alpha+1)-2^d+\beta+\alpha &,& i \geq 2^d - \beta
   * \end{array}\right.
   * \f]
   *
   * It can be seen that the maximum (also assumed as expected here) number
   *  of splits at a given depth is given by \f$2^d\f$. Therefore, geometry
   *  level building process is guaranteed to be applicable at least while
   *  \f$k \geq 2^d\f$ is satisfied.
   * Moreover, any split can be understood as a set of primitives
   *  \f$P_i = \left\{
   *      p_j \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 3} :
   *      j \in [\phi \geq 1, \psi \leq m]
   *  \right\}\f$,
   *  so the total number of primitives is \f$m\f$ (which is the cardinality
   *  of \f$P_0\f$ at \f$d=0\f$) and each primitive is
   *  itself a set of \f$n\f$ points in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$. Of course, this
   *  is a simplification since different types of primitives are supported
   *  by Helios. However, it is not necessary to get into that level of
   *  detail to understand this algorithm. Just notice that \f$P_i\f$ at
   *  \f$d = x\f$ is distinct that \f$P_i\f$ at \f$d = y\f$ as long as
   *  \f$x \neq y\f$ is satisfied. It is because once a node is splitted,
   *  it is understood as destroyed in this context so it is simply replaced
   *  by its children at next depth level.
   *
   * Finally, the last depth at which geometry level parallelization applies
   *  can be deduced from the fact that the number of threads for
   *  a parallel algorithm is going to satisfy \f$k>1\f$. For then it follows
   *  that \f$\log_2{k} \geq 0\f$. Notice this would stand even for the
   *  sequential case because \f$\log_2{1} = 0\f$. In consequence, it is
   *  known that \f$k \geq 2^d \iff \log_2{k} \geq d\f$, because the
   *  logarithm will not change the sign. But, from aforementioned
   *  inequation, the last depth label can be defined as
   *  \f$d^* = \left\lfloor{\log_2{k}}\right\rfloor\f$
